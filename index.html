			My first knitting lesson was just before I turned ten (i.e. sometime in the fall of 1994), and I’ve been fairly active at knitting since then.  Although I learned the most basic of basics from my mother (casting on and off, knit/purl, possibly basic decreases), most of what I know came from reading a book or article and experimenting on my own.  I classify my current knitting skill level as “barking mad”.  I also happen to be a decent crocheter (I think my first lesson was roughly a year after I learned to knit), but I’m definitely nowhere near as skilled at crochet as I am with knitting.  My first published design, the Awry Hat and Mitts, appeared in Knitscene Accessories 2015.

			I do consider myself a computer nerd, although I’ve gone a wee bit soft since switching from my old Linux box to a Mac.  But I think I get points for using the command-line on occasion and still being able to grok what a piece of code in a high-level language I’ve never studied probably does after staring at it for several minutes and crossing my eyes.  I eventually aspire to be a polyglot…I have a moderate amount of skill in Spanish, my German is quite rusty, and I just started on French.
